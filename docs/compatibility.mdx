# AI Platform Compatibility

MCP Atlassian works with any MCP-compatible client. This page documents platform-specific notes and known issues.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Platform | Status | Transport | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | Fully supported | stdio | Primary development target |
| Cursor | Fully supported | stdio | |
| Windsurf | Fully supported | stdio | |
| VS Code (Copilot) | Supported | stdio | See [Copilot setup](#github-copilot) |
| Vertex AI / Google ADK | Supported | stdio / HTTP | Schema sanitization applied automatically |
| Amazon Bedrock | Compatible | stdio / HTTP | Not explicitly tested |
| LiteLLM | Compatible | stdio / HTTP | Passes schemas to underlying provider |
| OpenAI Gateway | Compatible | stdio / HTTP | |
| ChatGPT | Not tested | HTTP | See [ChatGPT notes](#chatgpt) |

## Schema Compatibility

MCP Atlassian includes automatic schema sanitization to ensure compatibility with strict AI platforms:

- **`anyOf` flattening**: Pydantic v2 generates `anyOf` patterns for optional parameters (`T | None`). These are automatically collapsed to simple `{"type": T}` before schemas are sent to clients, since Vertex AI and Google ADK reject `anyOf` alongside `default` or `description` fields.
- **No zero-argument tools**: All tools have at least one parameter, which is required by some OpenAI-compatible gateways.
- **All properties have explicit `type`**: Required by Vertex AI.
- **No `$defs` / `$ref`**: All schemas are fully inlined.

These constraints are enforced by CI tests across all tools.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot's coding agent supports MCP servers via stdio transport. Key configuration notes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use stdio transport">
    Copilot's agent mode uses stdio, not HTTP. Configure as a standard MCP server:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "mcp-atlassian": {
          "command": "uvx",
          "args": ["mcp-atlassian"],
          "env": {
            "JIRA_URL": "https://your-instance.atlassian.net",
            "JIRA_USERNAME": "your-email@example.com",
            "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify tool discovery">
    If Copilot reports "Retrieved 0 tools", ensure you are using `mcp-atlassian >= 0.16.0` (which includes FastMCP updates for better protocol compliance).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Docker alternative">
    When using Docker, expose via stdio (not HTTP):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "mcp-atlassian": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run", "-i", "--rm",
            "-e", "JIRA_URL=https://your-instance.atlassian.net",
            "-e", "JIRA_USERNAME=your-email@example.com",
            "-e", "JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token",
            "ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Vertex AI / Google ADK

Vertex AI enforces strict JSON Schema validation. The automatic `anyOf` flattening resolves the `INVALID_ARGUMENT` errors previously reported with Google ADK.

If you encounter schema errors, ensure you are running the latest version:

```bash
uvx mcp-atlassian@latest
```

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT's MCP integration has reported vague "violates guidelines" errors. This may be related to schema validation but no specific diagnostics are available. If you encounter this, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian/issues) with the exact error message.

## HTTP Transport

For platforms that require HTTP transport (e.g., remote deployments, gateways), see the [HTTP Transport](/docs/http-transport) guide.
